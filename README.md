# Monthly-Budget-Report
SQL Project 
Objective

We’ve prepared some sample data for the first quarter of 2020 (January, February, and March) to show you how you can create and analyze a budget.

we’ll create a single table named Monthly_budget_item. This table will hold information about all our expenses and income. 
There will only be four columns:

1- Date—The date of the expense or income.
2- Category—The item category, such as “food” or “health” (a maximum of 32 characters).
3- Description—The detailed description of the given item, such as “rent” or “electricity bill” (a maximum of 128 characters).
4- Amount—The amount that we earned (positive number) or spent (negative number).

Query to solve:

1- What’s the quarterly balance? Do we have any money left?
2- Find the balance for each month individually.
3- Write an instruction that will show the monthly sums for individual categories.
4- Analyze Food, Entertainment, transport, categories in one-by-one in detail. 

Conclusion:
We spent much more on fuel in March than we spent on metro tickets in the first two months. We could save some money by using public transport instead of a car.
